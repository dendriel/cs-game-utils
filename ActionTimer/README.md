Action timer provides the funcionality to trigger a callback after a given delay.

- It's possible to set a fixed or a random (between min and max) delay.
- It's possible to store a parameter T to be passed as input in the callback.
- It's possible to interrupt the timer.
- If you just need a delay, use Cooldown instead.
