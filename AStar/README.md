A* Solver

Files:
+ AStarSolver.cs
+ IAStarNode.cs

This is an implementation of the A* algorithm. I had implemented this algorithm for solving sokoban mazes but generalized the source code so it may be used for game development purposes. Look for may repositories (https://github.com/dendriel) so you can check out AStarSolver in action (it was used in Move Box Solver project).
